So when she reincarnates into a world with magic, she gladly takes up the mercenary’s path for a second time. Drawing upon her battle-hardened experience, she forms the mercenary group Moon Blossom and pioneers the concept of the soldier-mage: magic users who also fight with the skills and training of military soldiers. Roaming the battlefields of this new world, Moon Blossom—led by Asura and her unrivaled schemes, ruthlessness, and tactical ingenuity—earns a fearsome reputation. Thus the curtain rises on the dark fantasy epic of a young girl who is spoken of in fearful whispers as “The Silver Demon”!",

In every life, she’s been betrayed by her fiancé, abused by her noble family, and laid low by an untimely end all because she was unable to awaken the power of Sun, a so-called protective gift passed down in her family. Yet Selene is determined to escape this cursed time loop and, after her ninth demise, abandons any further attempts to be a good girl. She awakens to the power of Shadow—seen as an ominous portent of misfortune—and fully embraces her new life as a villainess.\n\nBut Selene’s dark path is about to take another strange turn when Dier Veldt, the former crown prince, reveals that he knows all about her time loop. He even offers his help, but under one condition: she must kill him in exchange. With her newfound villainy, can Selene break free of this endless time loop once and for all?",

She accordingly prepares for the worst, but a monster hunter named Nelly takes her in. The hitch is...now that Sarasa finally has the energy to do everything she wants to, being cooped up in a cabin is just no fun!

He’s now a handsome marquess who acts like a spoiled child around her, and wherever he goes, strange incidents follow. You see, Sieghart’s beauty attracts both people and...otherworldly admirers.

You can’t fly across several countries on an ancient dragon without turning a few heads, after all, and this time around, “trouble” has pointy ears, a terrible work ethic, and a pathological obsession with dragonkind even more intense than Mukohda’s desire to not get involved with any of this nonsense.

One particular worry is the enemy’s rapid development of gunpowder-based weapons, which has made defeat all but inevitable. \n\nUnfortunately, Carol insists on witnessing the fighting for herself, and Yuri feels he has no choice but to be there by her side to protect her. \n\nStill, with some careful planning, provisioning, and talented friends by his side, Yuri doubts the expedition will run into any major trouble. After all, they’ll merely be there to observe, not to fight. The only problem is that war can be unpredictable.",

Now everyone—from average citizens to soldiers—explores these monster-filled labyrinths in search of wealth, power, and magic.\n\nKeigo Yoshimura is an office worker with no sense of adventure, who dreams of quitting his job to live the easy life. While out on a business call, he stumbles on the birth of a new dungeon and accidentally gains a magical skill that turns subterranean exploration into an RPG. Things spiral out of control and Keigo winds up as the world’s top explorer. \n\nWith help from Azusa Miyoshi, his mathematically gifted colleague and new business partner in dungeon diving, he might be able to turn the status screens he sees into piles of cash.
