# JNC-API
## README

This is a JavaScript code snippet that fetches data from the J-Novel Club API and dynamically creates book elements based on the retrieved data. It is designed to be used in a web application to display information about books.

### Functionality
The code performs the following tasks:

1. Calls the `newFunction` function.
2. Inside `newFunction`, waits for the DOM to be fully loaded using `document.addEventListener`.
3. Fetches JSON data from the J-Novel Club API endpoint: `https://labs.j-novel.club/app/v1/series/ascendance-of-a-bookworm/volumes?format=json`.
4. Converts the response data to JSON format.
5. Retrieves the book volumes from the fetched data.
6. Iterates through each book volume.
7. Creates a `div` element with the class "book" to represent each book volume.
8. Creates an `h2` element to display the book title.
9. Creates an `img` element to display the book cover image.
10. Creates a `p` element to display the book description.
11. Creates a `p` element to display the author's name.
12. Appends the created elements to the `booksContainer` element.
13. Finally, if any error occurs during the process, it will be logged to the console.

### Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Call the `newFunction` function to initiate the process.
2. Ensure the DOM is fully loaded before executing the code.
3. The code will fetch book data from the J-Novel Club API and dynamically create book elements in the specified `booksContainer` element.
4. The book elements will include the book title, cover image, description, and author's name.

Note: Make sure to replace the `booksContainer` element with the appropriate element ID or select it using another method.

Please refer to the code comments for further details and customization options.
